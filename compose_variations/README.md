Bit of a work in progress - goal is to have these files here as ready-to-go
variations for different db's and configs.  But in practice I just sortof
fix them up each time as I need them.


| file                               |
-------------------------------------|
|docker-compose.mlflow_postgres.yaml |
|docker-compose.mlflow_sqlite.yaml   |
|docker-compose.orig.yaml            |
|docker-compose.mlflow_mysql.yaml    |
|docker-compose.updated_orig.yaml    |


Just copy the given file to ../docker-compose.yaml.
