# Makefile for docker/mlflow/db/etc setup.  Most of this is really just for
# testing or miscellaneous needs, as the docker-compose file covers most of
# this already.  Two main exceptions are: mlflowpopulate which is handy for
# generating test entries in mlflow, and psqld which can provide psql entry
# directly into the mlflow db for the docker-compose files that allow it,
# which does NOT include the default one - need the ones that don't hide
# database on a backend network, like docker-compose.mlflow_postgres.yaml).
#
# Note sortof hardwired choice of postgres db in this makefile corresponding to
# the default docker-compose.yaml file in root dir.
